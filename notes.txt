express for the server
dotenv to create environment variables
cookie-parser for parsing cookies
bcryptjs for hashing passwords
mongoose for mongodb
socket.io for RT communicaiton
JSONwebtokens to create JSON tokens


nodemon is used to watch the Express server and automatically refresh it whenever a change is made.

process.env is the NodeJS way of reading environment variables, not express or React

Express allows us to use middleware with app.use. this saves us from having to create a bunch of routes over and over

I think express.Router is creating a generic router object for redirecting http requests to common filepaths. So anything that goest through /api/auth will trigger the AuthRoutes function, which will figure out which route to use based on the full URL.
